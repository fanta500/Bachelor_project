# Bachelor_project
We will be making progressive visualisations of MAST data from the Kepler Space Mission. Akin to a sky map.

Must haves to run:
1. Node.js
2. npm

Installing and running:
1. Run 'npm install' in the cloned directory
2. Overwrite ./node_modules/p4.js/src/vis/visualize.js with ./demos/visualize.js as some changes to the source had to be made
3. Run 'npm start' and go to 'localhost:8080/demos'
4. Use the provided dataset(s) in ./demos/FILE-NAME.csv
5. To restart the pipeline, refresh the webpage
6. If you run out of VRAM, restart the browser
